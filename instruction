Download Instructions:

From the TdhGIS.com, Downloads page, click on the version you wish to download, TdhGIS_win or TdhGIS_linux. A google docs page will be displayed (you will need to have a google docs account, which can be created free of charge). For Linux, only a 64-bit version is currently available. 
Click on the the file name, TdhGIS_win.zip or TdhGIS_linux64.zip. A different google docs page will be displayed listing the contents of the zip file. Do not attempt to execute the setup or install file at this point.
From the menu on the google docs page, click on File | Download to download the zip file.


Install Instructions:

Go to the directory where the downloaded zip file was placed.
Double click on the file to open your archive manager.
For MS Windows:

Extract the Setup file to the directory of your choice.
Double click on the Setup file to begin the install process.
The operating system and any virus protection software may give ominous warnings about running executable files, that is how they protect and justify themselves. If a message appears saying windows prevented an unrecognized app from starting, click on the "more info" text and then click "run anyway".
For Linux: 

Extract the zip file to the directory of your choice. Open the ReadMe.pdf file and follow the instructions.
If you have a previous version, extract to the same directory (user data will not be lost).
If the program does not start, you may need to add some standard libraries. In a terminal session, enter “sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-0”.
